## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] – 2023-12-11

### Changed

- Doodle illustrations must be placed in a media collection in the backend rather than in the hard coded `src/assets/images/verk/` folder in the frontend. Use `collections.mediaCollectionMappings` in `config.ts` to map the id of the collection with doodles to the id of the media collection that holds the images in the backend. ([9fd9d0e](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/9fd9d0e7ab003e2d0dc3fd18c6e8c0edba88d7f5), [02d3d21](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/02d3d21fbdc24f785e29db6a80acbe8409e91d0d))
- Illustration image path mapping to media collections is performed solely based on the presence of the CSS class name `est_figure_graphic` on `img` elements – not as previously based on the image `src` containing `assets/images/verk/` in it. Thus, illustration images that are to be mapped to media collections must have just the image file names in the `src` attributes, rather than `images/verk/<filename>` as previously. Images with absolute URLs in `src` are never mapped regardless of class names. ([2b4f4e6](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/2b4f4e6fed6020562e0927c8a72969662a80e536))
- Fixing image paths in collection pages from `images/` to `assets/images/` is done specifically at the start of `src` attribute values – not for any occurrence of the string `images/`. ([111f902](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/111f9022c4771f271cb812fc9c887c0faa93ece3))

### Removed

- Apply background colors to toggle labels only instead of the entire toggles in the view options popover. ([fc2fc38](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/fc2fc38c64d3c4d66c2838769f9cac74f0a72a08))

- Move inline styles for checkbox labels on the elastic-search page to the component SCSS-file. ([8d0a766](https://github.com/slsfi/digital-edition-frontend-ng/commit/8d0a76692396c77715fa570ac32e8f19bfd6b41a))
